# PondMonitor-RCBoat

# Description:
Welcome to the **PondMonitor-RCBoat** project! This repository features an innovative IoT solution designed to monitor vital environmental parameters in ponds, utilizing a remote-controlled boat equipped with various sensors. By continuously measuring and transmitting data, this project aims to provide valuable insights into water quality, essential for environmental research, aquaculture, and ecosystem monitoring.

The **PondMonitor-RCBoat** is equipped with several key sensors to ensure comprehensive data collection:

- **pH Sensor**: This sensor accurately measures the acidity or alkalinity of the pond water, crucial for understanding its ecological balance and the health of aquatic life.
- **DS18B20 Temperature Sensor**: This high-precision sensor monitors water temperature, providing critical data on thermal conditions that affect aquatic ecosystems.
- **Dissolved Oxygen Sensor**: This sensor gauges the levels of oxygen present in the water, an essential factor for fish survival and overall pond health.
- **DHT22 Sensor**: This sensor monitors both environmental humidity and ambient temperature, offering insights into atmospheric conditions that impact the pond environment.
- **Ultrasonic Distance Sensor**: This optional sensor can measure water depth, providing additional context for the data collected and helping to understand the pond's physical characteristics.

Data collected from these sensors is transmitted in real-time to the Blynk cloud platform, allowing for easy access and visualization. Users can monitor changes and trends over time, facilitating better decision-making for pond management and conservation efforts.

The **PondMonitor-RCBoat** project encourages collaboration and knowledge sharing. We invite contributors to explore the code, hardware configurations, and setup instructions included in this repository. Whether youâ€™re a hobbyist, student, or researcher, this project provides an excellent opportunity to engage with IoT technology while making a positive impact on environmental monitoring. Join us in our mission to enhance our understanding of aquatic ecosystems and promote sustainable practices!
